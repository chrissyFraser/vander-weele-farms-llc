* Forked and cloned remote repo
* create the front end home pages, login/logout, cart view, create product wireframes in the api-design.
* created heroku account

10.04:
* created and dockerized a service directory
* started creating database and dockerizing it before learning I don't need that

10.05:
* Got the local database built, dockerize and pushed to the repo.
* Got get and create products built but not yet working. I think that something is going on with the yml file, the user and password are not being recognized by the pool.
