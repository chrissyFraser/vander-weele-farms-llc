09.29:
- Added journal page
- Created list customers and new customer api design psudeo code for end points

9.30
- Worked with team to update API endpoints

10.03
Today I worked on:
- Adding all features as issues
- We started assigning issues
- I learned the format journal entries should be
  
  We realized we had a misunderstanding about how we should go about achieving our stretch goal, and came to the conclusion that assigning orders to trucks didn't need to be so complicated (so maybe we will get that implemented before the project is due).

  Parts of Fast APIs seem to be making sense to me, but I still need to get into some actual coding using them before I can say I have an understanding of how things work.

  Team deployed under construction page!
