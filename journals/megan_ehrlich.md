Today I worked on:
- Adding all features as issues
- We started assigning issues
- I learned the format journal entries should be
  
  We realized we had a misunderstanding about how we should go about achieving our stretch goal, and came to the conclusion that assigning orders to trucks didn't need to be so complicated (so maybe we will get that implemented before the project is due).

  Parts of Fast APIs seem to be making sense to me, but I still need to get into some actual coding using them before I can say I have an understanding of how things work.

  Team deployed under construction page!

  Today I worked on:
  - Authentication research
    - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/ 
    - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/first-steps/
    - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/#oauth2-scopes-and-openapi
    - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/#oauth2passwordrequestform
  - Then I found out that was best saved for later
  I followed the fastapi tutorial for OAuth2 authentication, and got a test version to run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default. After playing around with it I understand some of what is happening and feel good putting it aside until we get some more information.
